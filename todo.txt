Create genetic algorithm:

1) Population which is randomised
2) Evlauate the fitness of the population
3) Select population members for mating
4) Crossover population
5) Randomly mutate child node
6) Add to next generation

Fitness Function:
*Needs to be the element that scores the highest
*Any other parameters to add?

Population:
*Have parameters associated with their respective vector from midpoint of pipe
*Sigmoid-esque activation
